# functional-programming
Functional programming is a paradigm that focuses on the construction of software applying functions and declarative programming

## FP is based on:

- Declarative programming:
instructing a program on what needs to be done, instead of telling it how to do it.

- Pure functions:
A pure functions is a function that given a value is going to return the same result and it does not have side effects

- High order functions:
A high order function is a functions that could receive another functions as a parameter or a function that returns another function.

- Referential transparency:


- Immutability:
It is a state in which a value cannot be mutate, 


## Thinking functionally

In order to start using functional programming you need to think in terms of pure operations, data that never mutates, functions with single responsability, this definitely reduce the potential for bugs and help to improve the readiness of the code. Understanding the core principles is important in order to reap the benefits functional programming brings to your code, which will guide you on the path to overcoming complexity.


## Programming paradigms

Each programming paradigm has its benefits, I'm going to talk about some programming paradigms: functional programming, procedural programming and object oriented programming.

### Functional programming

- Reduces the amount of bugs because the use of pure functions and immutability
- Improves readiness of the code because it promote declarative programming
- Improves reusability of the code
- Helps to separate side effects flows from pure flow


### Object oriented programming

- Focuses on representing the real word through entities
- Makes code reusable
- A little bit more complex from my point of view

### Procedural programming

- Focuses on a more step by step style code
- Usually code develop with this style is harder to understand 

### Comparison

- Functional programming promotes reusability through function,while OOP promotes reusability thrugh Classess, inheritance, poliformism, so reusability depends of the classess. 

- Functional programming focuses on inmutable data, while OPP promote mutability through objects

- Functional programming use declarative programming, meanwhile procedural programming is more imperative
