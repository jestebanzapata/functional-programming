# functional-programming
Functional programming is a paradigm that focuses on the construction of software applying functions and declarative programming

## FP is based on:

Declarative programming
Pure functions
High order functions
Referential transparency
Immutability

## Thinking functionally

In order to start using functional programming you need to think in terms of pure operations, data that never mutates, functions with single responsability, this definitely reduce the potential for bugs and help to improve the readiness of the code. Understanding the core principles is important in order to reap the benefits functional programming brings to your code, which will guide you on the path to overcoming complexity.


## Pogramming paradigms

Each programming paradigm has its benefits, I'm going to talk about some programming paradigms: functional programming, procedural programming and object oriented programming.

### Functional programming

- Reduces the amount of bugs because the use of pure functions and immutability
- Improves readiness of the code because it promote declarative programming
- Improves reusability of the code
- Helps to separate side effects flows from pure flow


### Object oriented programming

- Focuses on representing the real word through entities
- Makes code reusable
- A little bit more complex from my point of view

### Procedural programming

- Focuses on a more step by step style code
- Usually code develop with this style is harder to understand 

### Comparison

- Functional programming promotes reusability through function,while OOP promotes reusability thrugh Classess, inheritance, poliformism, so reusability depends of the classess. 

- Functional programming focuses on inmutable data, while OPP promote mutability through objects

- Functional programming use declarative programming (instructing a program on what needs to be done, instead of telling it how to do it), meanwhile procedural programming is more imperative
